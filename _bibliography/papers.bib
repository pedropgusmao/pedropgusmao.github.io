  title       = {End-to-End Speech Recognition from Federated Acoustic Models},
  abstract    = {Training Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models under federated learning (FL) settings has attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the FL scenarios often presented in the literature are artificial and fail to capture the complexity of real FL systems. In this paper, we construct a challenging and realistic ASR federated experimental setup consisting of clients with heterogeneous data distributions using the French and Italian sets of the CommonVoice dataset, a large heterogeneous dataset containing thousands of different speakers, acoustic environments and noises. We present the first empirical study on attention-based sequence-to-sequence End-to-End (E2E) ASR model with three aggregation weighting strategies -- standard FedAvg, loss-based aggregation and a novel word error rate (WER)-based aggregation, compared in two realistic FL scenarios: cross-silo with 10 clients and cross-device with 2K and 4K clients. Our analysis on E2E ASR from heterogeneous and realistic federated acoustic models provides the foundations for future research and development of realistic FL-based ASR applications.},

  abstract    = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model, while keeping their training data on the device, thereby decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. However, FL is difficult to implement and deploy in practice, considering the heterogeneity in mobile devices, e.g., different programming languages, frameworks, and hardware accelerators. Although there are a few frameworks available to simulate FL algorithms (e.g., TensorFlow Federated), they do not support implementing FL workloads on mobile devices. Furthermore, these frameworks are designed to simulate FL in a server environment and hence do not allow experimentation in distributed mobile settings for a large number of clients. In this paper, we present Flower (https://flower.dev/), a FL framework which is both agnostic towards heterogeneous client environments and also scales to a large number of clients, including mobile and embedded devices. Flower's abstractions let developers port existing mobile workloads with little overhead, regardless of the programming language or ML framework used, while also allowing researchers flexibility to experiment with novel approaches to advance the state-of-the-art. We describe the design goals and implementation considerations of Flower and show our experiences in evaluating the performance of FL across clients with heterogeneous computational and communication capabilities. },

  abstract    = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system typically employ vision-based sensors to observe the surrounding environment. However, the performance of such systems highly depends on the ambient illumination conditions. In scenarios with adverse visibility or in the presence of airborne particulates (e.g. smoke, dust, etc.), alternative modalities such as those based on thermal imaging and inertial sensors are more promising. In this paper, we propose the first complete thermal-inertial SLAM system which combines neural abstraction in the SLAM front end with robust pose graph optimization in the SLAM back end. We model the sensor abstraction in the front end by employing probabilistic deep learning parameterized by Mixture Density Networks (MDN). Our key strategies to successfully model this encoding from thermal imagery are the usage of normalized 14-bit radiometric data, the incorporation of hallucinated visual (RGB) features, and the inclusion of feature selection to estimate the MDN parameters. To enable a full SLAM system, we also design an efficient global image descriptor which is able to detect loop closures from thermal embedding vectors. We performed extensive experiments and analysis using three datasets, namely self-collected ground robot and handheld data taken in indoor environment, and one public dataset (SubT-tunnel) collected in underground tunnel. Finally, we demonstrate that an accurate thermal-inertial SLAM system can be realized in conditions of both benign and adverse visibility. },
